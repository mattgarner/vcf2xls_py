1 ROI as gene list
2 Get all GENCODE refseqs for genes
3 Get intervals for refseqs
4 Get variants for intervals (gene by gene for all samples to enable inheritance classification)
5 Add further annotations
6 Output variants
7 Check output against vcf in ROI







1.
Inputs:
SampleID -> Manifest
SampleID + Panel(s) -> Custom analysis
vcf -> Manifest for each sample (might be diff panels per sample)
vcf + Panel(s) -> Custom analysis
vcf + sample_ID -> Manifest for that sample
vcf + sampleID + panel -> Custom analysis for that panel and sample


Should generate a dict sample:[genes]
