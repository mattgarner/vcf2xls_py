Python script to convert gemini vcf into xls report

For writing each variant sheet:


g_num -> panel_ids
panel_ids -> list of genes
chosen_panels_dict = {}
for panel_id in panel_ids:
    panel_id -> panel_dict
    chosen_panels_dict[panel_id] = panel_dict


vcf selection - let user enter either a gnum or a path

Possible error in existing script:

    When a variant has 2 alts only the first is reported
    Only indication that the patient has a second var at that posn is 1,1 genotype


    When assigning variants to sheets - what to do when a multialt gets split between sheets!
    Options; 
        Adjacent - one will be in the wrong sheet
        Flag as multialt with pointer to other in pair
        Both vars in both sheets?

OMIM API:
Only disorders have IM
Genes do not
Therefore need to get the disorders associated with each gene
Then get the IM for each disorder
Maybe filter them by panel - would require matching OMIM disorder names with 
panel names - probably dodgy

Take in vcf
Check exists
    If not exit
Check if .annotated.vcf
    If not annotate in orig vcf dir and save as .annotated.vcf
    Make annotated the new vcf for subsequent processing

If filename == G:

If filename == C:

If filename == IC:




Take an annotated or unannotated vcf, or sampleID(ambiguous)?
From that generate an annotated vcf - requires multiple steps
From filename>manifest or as specified in args determine panels
From panels determine genes
Built gene data dict
Extract data from vcf according to regions defined by data dict.









Depth across multiple transcripts - arrrgh!

Depth in tx1 = x/y

    subtract
    regions of tx_n not in tx1 = r2
Depth in tx2 = cov in r2/r2












Need to check how variants in multiple txs are currently presented in xls, and how best to do this

Multiple rows - 1 per alt
and 
Multiple row - 1 per tx

therefore up to 2 x num_tx rows per variant






To Do Friday

Need to handle transcript version number mismatches when building csq dict! 
Is this always safe to do? How can versions differ?

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK50679/#RefSeqFAQ.what_causes_the_version_number)

    1) Indels/mismatches
    2) Extend/truncate 5' or 3' coding/UTR, no addition/removal of exons
    3) 2, but with addition/removal of terminal exons. No addition/deletion of internal exons or splice sites

Tentatively done - ignore version in making the match, and display the version in the vcf within the xls


HNC2 primers NM_001194.3 616017



Adjust record in regions to return within genes, not exons. i.e. all exons & introns and 5'/3' +/- x

What counts as splicing varinats - according to VEP vs range from boundary




How to define target regions if not with target transcripts?

For each variant in target region
    report on target transcript(s) if present in annotation
    report all other transcripts if target transcript(s) absent


NGS genotyping
sampleID and index
results.csv






How to define target regions:

Take gencode gtf
    filter to protein coding gene_type transcript_type

    for each gene
        build a dict of transcripts
        for each tx
            build a dict of exons

        collapse all exons into a set of ranges which define the gene
